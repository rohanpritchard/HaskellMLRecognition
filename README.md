# HaskellMLRecognition
This is my attempt at firstly, building a simple ML Decision Tree classifier library and then (if I have time) utilising it to build a basic handwriting recognition tool. The whole project is to be completed from scratch by myself and all in Haskell. I will be using ID3 to build the decision trees.
